These restaurants cover nearly every type of international cuisine. It will be challenging for visitors to find the closest restaurants to them that fit their taste.\n\nSo, how can we leverage Foursquare API data to help us find the best restaurants for each visitor in Tokyo? In this project, Foursquare location data and clustering methods will be used to group the different districts according to their restaurant information.\n\nDescription of the Data\nFor this project, a list of Special Wards (districts) in Tokyo\nData Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo\nDescription: We will use the above website source to get the list of all the Special Wards of Tokyo and some other information about them.\n\nRestaurants in each of the Special Wards (districts) in Tokyo\nData Source: Foursquare API\nDescription: These will help us get all the restaurants in each neighborhood. This can also be filtered to show the most popular restaurants in each area."
